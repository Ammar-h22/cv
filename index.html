<!-- 
    Note:
    1) For doing italic font there are 2 options i.e <em> & <i>, both will do the same thing
       but we should use the <em> tag instead of <i> tag, because <em> tag not just makes the text
       italic but it also emphasizes on that particular text.

    2) Similarly, for bold font there are 2 options i.e <strong> & <b>, both will do the same thing
       but we should use the <strong> tag instead of <b> tag, because <strong> tag not just makes
       the text bold but also it shows/means important text.

    3) The <img> tag is used to insert an image in an HTML page. The <img> tag has two required attributes:
       src - Specifies the path to the image.
       alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.
       Inside src = " ": 
       * We can give the 'image address' if we want photo from google.
       * We can give the direct name of the image if it is present in the project itself.
       * We can also give the path if the image is somewhere in the cmoputer.

    4) <p> tag is used for paragraph form. Browsers automatically add a single blank line before 
       and after each <p> element. And it is not self-closing tag so we need to close it by </p>.

    5) There are two types of lits we can create in html: Ordered list and Unordered list.
       <ol> is used to create Ordered list & <ul> is used to create Unordered list.
       In both of these lists we can write the content inside <li> tag. And note that all the 3 are
       not self-closing tags.

    6) The <a> tag is known as anchor tag. It defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page 
       to another. The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates 
       the link's destination.
